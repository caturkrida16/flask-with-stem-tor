I'm just want to upload this code because "0-harshit-0" done a issue in stem problem.

## Requirements
1. Install the Tor proxy server in your PC
2. Windows: 
"C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\tor" open this directory, and move the file "torrc" inside that directory
3. After that run your Tor proxy server, and then run "main.py"
